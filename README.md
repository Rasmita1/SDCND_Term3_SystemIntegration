# System Integration Project
In this project the core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following is implemented. 

### Documentation
1. [Instructions for setting up development environment](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone)
2. System architecture  


### Implementation details

We have been following the software architecture specified by the course. However we noticed that the `Obstacle Detection` module has been removed and therefore no `/obstacle_waypoint` has been published or subscribed.
